		v_id:
			Never actually used anywhere, but exists to help see how the code is structured.
			Vehicles have an ID randing from [1, vehicle_count], as in other fields '0' 
			indicates no vehicle.
		v_available:
			Whether the vehicle is available for a dispatch decision (to be sent to the next
			location). This starts out as all true, & is set to false when a dispatch has been
			received. Set back to true when vehicle has reached a location.
		v_transit_start:
			If the vehicle is in transit, this indicates the origin. If a vehicle is not moving,
			this simply indicates its position.
		v_transit_end:
			If the vehicle is in transit, this indicates the target. If a vehicle is not moving,
			this also simply indicates its position. When trying to get the current position
			of a vehicle, this is used as it is more up to date than `v_transit_start`.
		v_transit_remaining:
			Integer indicating the remaining number of minutes before a vehicle reaches its
			destination. This is decremented by 1 every `step()` if not already 0.
		v_has_package:
			ID of package contained in vehicle, 0 if none.
		
		p_id:
			Same as `v_id`, only an indicator.
		p_location_current:
			Initialized as the origin location of a package. If this package is picked up by a
			vehicle, it remains as the vehicles starting location until the destination is
			reached. A package is delivered when this equals the target destination.
		p_location_target:
			ID of the place that the package needs to be delivered to.
		p_carrying_vehicle:
			ID of vehicle currently carrying package, 0 if none.
		p_delivered:
			Boolean to act as a shorthand for `p_location_current == p_location_target`.
		p_transit_extra:
			The ratio between the ideal # of timesteps a package needs to get delivered
			(directly from origin to target) & the # of timesteps it actually took to get there.
			In the ideal case, this value would be 1, while taking double the time is 1/2. This
			is later used as a multiplier for the reward function.
